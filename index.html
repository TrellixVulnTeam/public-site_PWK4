<h4><a href="https://github.com/jpal29/EPL_SCRAPER">Web Scraper built using Python</a></h4>
<p>Cool web scraper that I built to collect player statistics from the English Premier
League.</p>
<h4><a href="/docker_with_flask.html">Creating a Docker Compose File for a Flask app</a></h4>
<p>Quick how-to for future reference.</p>
<h4><a href="http://news-congregator.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/">News Aggregator built using React</a></h4>
<p>This was an app I built using React. It utilizes the <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News API</a> to collect 
news articles and then creates a dashboard with the different article categories. The user can then 
drill down into the respective categories and select a news provider with articles pertaining to that
specific category. The source code for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/jpal29/news-aggregator">here</a>.</p>
