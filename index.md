#### [Web Scraper built using Python](https://github.com/jpal29/EPL_SCRAPER)

Cool web scraper that I built to collect player statistics from the English Premier
League.

#### [Creating a Docker Compose File for a Flask app](/docker_with_flask.html)

Quick how-to for future reference.

#### [News Aggregator built using React](http://news-congregator.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

This was an app I built using React. It utilizes the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to collect 
news articles and then creates a dashboard with the different article categories. The user can then 
drill down into the respective categories and select a news provider with articles pertaining to that
specific category. The source code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/jpal29/news-aggregator).
